/**
 * Approach:
 * - This problem is a variation of the House Robber problem.
 * - First, convert the input into a frequency-based sum array: `sum[i]` holds total points from all i's.
 * - Deleting an element `i` earns `sum[i]` points but forces us to skip `i-1` and `i+1`.
 * - So, the problem reduces to choosing elements from the `sum[]` array such that no two adjacent indices are chosen â€” classic DP.
 * - Apply bottom-up dynamic programming:
 *   - For each `i` from 2 to end: `sum[i] = max(sum[i-1], sum[i-2] + sum[i])`.
 * - Return `sum[10001]` which will contain the maximum points.
